# react-tailwind

This is a quick example of building a component-library with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [parcel](https://parceljs.org/), and react.

You can see it running [here](http://konsumer.js.org/react-tailwind/).

[This](https://github.com/emortlock/tailwind-react-ui) uses some of the same ideas, but is mroe complete. You should probly use that.
